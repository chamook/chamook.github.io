                        I design, architect, and build software that is robust, maintainable, and usable.
                        I also work to build and develop teams that reliably and sustainably deliver working
                        software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If software quality is bad, it won't be able to keep up with the needs of its users.
                        If a team doesn't have a solid foundation both in technical excellence and working
                        effectively together, they won't be able to produce quality software reliably. I like
                        to work hands-on with both aspects to ensure that we can produce working software now
                        and in the long term.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Delivering value from software often relies on more than a single team, I am passionate
                        about finding ways for systems and people to communicate effectively across boundaries to
                        produce the best outcomes possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I'm based in Copenhagen ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°, speak fluent Danish and English, and I'm excited to see
                      how we can work together to make software better.

                    <p>
                        I have worked across a range of client projects working on .NET backend services, web frontends,
                        and an iOS app. Some projects have been developed from scratch, where others have involved improving
                        and developing on an existing codebase. For new projects I have worked to strict quality standards
                        from the start and sought to ensure clear guidelines and documentation for other developers. On some
                        existing projects I have been added to the team specifically to improve code quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Across several projects I have mentored junior developers while making my own code contributions.
                        By involving them in the full development process, I have worked to improve their understanding of
                        different tools and technologies while ensuring that they can continuously contribute to a project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I run the recruiting process for our team including writing job postings, reviewing candidates and
                        running interviews with them - this has led to several successful new hires. I also joined a technical
                        interview for another team so they could learn to use the same model for interviewing. Additionally I
                        have taken responsiblity for running internal retrospectives to improve our ways of working and ensure
                        a positive working environment across the team.

                        I worked as part of a team developing a solution for monitoring and instructing autonomous
                        vehicles working at DFDS locations in collaboration with other companies. The software solution
                        comprised mainly of several .NET core microservices running in Kubernetes and communicated
                        primarily via Kafka events, the team and I had a strong focus on using DDD techniques to
                        establish bounded contexts and make use of a ubiquitous language across the project. As well as
                        the backend part of the solution, I also contributed to the frontend monitoring page
                        developed using React.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To facilitate demonstrations to stakeholders and to provide another option for testing the
                        system, I developed an iOS app using SwiftUI and LocationKit that allowed me to simulate an
                        autonomous vehicle operating in a given area - this provided both automatic position updates
                        over SignalR as well as user defined actions.

                    <p>
                        As part of internal knowledge sharing activities I was actively involved in the
                        developer book club, reading and discussing a number of books focused on software development.
                        I also made several contributions to the internally developed, open-source library for working
                        with Kafka events - <a href="https://github.com/dfds/dafda/">Dafda</a>.

                        Originally working as a backend developer building microservices running in
                        docker containers on Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform. I developed
                        several services in F# and C# - both HTTP APIs and services consuming
                        Pub/Sub messages. Over time I moved into a more "full stack" role continuing
                        to develop microservices in the backend, but also working on the iOS app
                        (after teaching myself Swift) building functionality that made use of the
                        new backend APIs (in Swift, using MVVM) and integrating it with some of the older parts of the
                        codebase written in Objective C. As part of changing CI provider, I was
                        extensively involved in improving the build automation for both backend
                        services and the iOS app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I introduced F# to the tech stack, I also worked heavily with training
                        and mentoring other developers - both to teach them a new programming
                        language and a new approach to solving problems, but also helping to
                        develop their existing skills. I was one of the co-creators of the dotnet
                        template that allowed developers to get a new microservice up and running
                        with standard configuration in either F# or C# with minimal effort. I also
                        was a member of the API Standards group within the tech department that
                        worked towards creating guidelines for how the API surface across many
                        microservices should work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I was involved in several recruitment processes, including reviewing
                        applications and running both social and technical interviews leading to
                        several good hires.

                        Adam is a passionate and skilled developer, who always strives for learning
                        new things and finding better ways of working. I've seen him being a great mentor
                        to those less experienced, as well as being a quick learner himself and appreciating
                        the feedback. Adam has a lot of empathy for his coworkers and he would be a great
                        asset to any team!

                        Adam is a very experienced developer who is passionate about developing
                        good quality software. At Storytel he was very engaged in recruiting and
                        onboarding/mentoring new
                        colleagues, active in the tech community (giving tech talks, writing blog
                        posts) and he enriched our tech stack with new technologies like F#. He is
                        a person with very high integrity and his contributions generally went
                        well beyond what was expected of him.
