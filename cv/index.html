                    I'm a software developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark where I've worked on a wide
                    range of software projects using a broad selection of technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I prefer to develop high quality solutions, with a well thought-out architecture
                    using up-to-date technologies to deliver highly usable and highly capable software
                    to users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently excited about working with <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a> and
                    <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a> - I love learning new languages and
                    discovering better ways of building software.

                    <p>
                        Originally working as a backend developer building microservices running in
                        docker containers on Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform. I developed
                        several services in F# and C# - both HTTP APIs and services consuming
                        Pub/Sub messages. Over time I moved into a more "full stack" role continuing
                        to develop microservices in the backend, but also working on the iOS app
                        (after teaching myself Swift) building functionality that made use of the
                        new backend APIs (in Swift, using MVVM) and integrating it with some of the older parts of the
                        codebase written in Objective C. As part of changing CI provider, I was
                        extensively involved in improving the build automation for both backend
                        services and the iOS app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I introduced F# to the tech stack, I also worked heavily with training
                        and mentoring other developers - both to teach them a new programming
                        language and a new approach to solving problems, but also helping to
                        develop their existing skills. I was one of the co-creators of the dotnet
                        template that allowed developers to get a new microservice up and running
                        with standard configuration in either F# or C# with minimal effort. I also
                        was a member of the API Standards group within the tech department that
                        worked towards creating guidelines for how the API surface across many
                        microservices should work.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, I was involved in several recruitment processes, including reviewing
                        applications and running both social and technical interviews leading to
                        several good hires.
