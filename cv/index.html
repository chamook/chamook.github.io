                    <p>
                        I architect, build, and deliver software solutions that are usable, maintainable
                        and effective. I help developers use their skills and learn new ones to enable them
			to produce better software more effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Software development can be better, and I love to explore new and different ways to
                        develop software that allow for faster feedback, greater robustness, and improved
                        capacity to meet the needs of users. Whether through exploring new programming
                        languages and technologies or by improving processes and ways of working to gain a
                        greater connection to users and a sharper focus on quality, I find it exciting to
                        discover the ways that we can be better at developing better software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I'm based in Copenhagen ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°, speak fluent Danish and English, and I'm excited to see
		      how we can work together to make software better.

		      I work directly with clients on business-critical codebases mostly working with C# and Azure cloud solutions, as well as
		      teaching developers how to work effectively with different tools and technologies. 
                    </p>
		    <p>
		      Internally, I run the recruiting process from writing job postings, to scheduling and running interviews with candidates.
		      I worked as part of a team to define the interview process, and have developed documentation and presentation materials for it.
		      Additionally, I create <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/copenhagen-software_is-your-organizations-software-development-activity-7118232141234069504-lYeS">
			informational video content</a> on LinkedIn to improve employer branding and raise awareness of products and services - these videos
		      have received significantly more engagement than other posts.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      As part of a directed effort to improve our own running of projects I have developed internal documentation to set standard
		      procedures. To ensure that all team members have the opportunity to contribute I have coordinated and facilitated meetings
		      using <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a> to maximize participation.

                    <p>
                        I worked as part of a team developing a solution for monitoring and instructing autonomous
                        vehicles working at DFDS locations in collaboration with other companies. The software solution
                        comprised mainly of several .NET core microservices running in Kubernetes and communicated
                        primarily via Kafka events, the team and I had a strong focus on using DDD techniques to
                        establish bounded contexts and make use of a ubiquitous language across the project. As well as
                        the backend part of the solution, I also contributed to the frontend monitoring page
                        developed using React.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To facilitate demonstrations to stakeholders and to provide another option for testing the
                        system, I developed an iOS app using SwiftUI and LocationKit that allowed me to simulate an
                        autonomous vehicle operating in a given area - this provided both automatic position updates
                        over SignalR as well as user defined actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of internal knowledge sharing activities I was actively involved in the
                        developer book club, reading and discussing a number of books focused on software development.
                        I also made several contributions to the internally developed, open-source library for working
                        with Kafka events - <a href="https://github.com/dfds/dafda/">Dafda</a>.

                        Originally working as a backend developer building microservices running in
                        docker containers on Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform. I developed
                        several services in F# and C# - both HTTP APIs and services consuming
                        Pub/Sub messages. Over time I moved into a more "full stack" role continuing
                        to develop microservices in the backend, but also working on the iOS app
                        (after teaching myself Swift) building functionality that made use of the
                        new backend APIs (in Swift, using MVVM) and integrating it with some of the older parts of the
                        codebase written in Objective C. As part of changing CI provider, I was
                        extensively involved in improving the build automation for both backend
                        services and the iOS app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I introduced F# to the tech stack, I also worked heavily with training
                        and mentoring other developers - both to teach them a new programming
                        language and a new approach to solving problems, but also helping to
                        develop their existing skills. I was one of the co-creators of the dotnet
                        template that allowed developers to get a new microservice up and running
                        with standard configuration in either F# or C# with minimal effort. I also
                        was a member of the API Standards group within the tech department that
                        worked towards creating guidelines for how the API surface across many
                        microservices should work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I was involved in several recruitment processes, including reviewing
                        applications and running both social and technical interviews leading to
                        several good hires.
