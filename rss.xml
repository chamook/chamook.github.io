  <title>Business Value Isn't Real, Only Vibes Can Be Trusted</title>
  <link>https://chamook.lol/value-vs-vibes/</link>
  <description>
    &lt;div id="content" class="container"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    When &lt;i&gt;Agile Influencers&lt;/i&gt; wade into attempting to answer the question of &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; to make rather
    than simply &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to go about making it the concept of &lt;i&gt;Business Value&lt;/i&gt; is often invoked as the
    measurestick by which to judge competing options. Simply pick the option that will deliver the
    maximum amount of &lt;i&gt;Business Value&lt;/i&gt; and your project will surely be a success and your team
    will certainly be productive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    I do not believe this is correct. I believe that &lt;i&gt;Business Value&lt;/i&gt; is an ill-defined idea, a lie, an
    irrelevance, and most assuredly not something you should allow to encroach on your decision
    making if you are serious about your craft (assuming of course, that misery is not your craft).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Blessed are the key stakeholders, for they will achieve the product goal
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    The Book of Scrum 4:19 (NIV)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-orgf532952" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="orgf532952"&gt;What is valuable to a business anyways?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf532952"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Under capitalism a business exists to concentrate wealth into the possession of its owners by
    making money &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This can be a motivating system to spur innovation and the production of
    goods and the deliverance of services that greatly improve the lives of all those who can
    purchase them. It can also lead to a bunch of weird dudes exploiting their way into hoarding a
    massive amount of wealth that they can use on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1AilPvC37c"&gt;meaningless days out&lt;/a&gt; and
    &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23460729/elon-musk-fire-twitter-engineers-dissent"&gt;being dicks to people at websites&lt;/a&gt;. So I think we could say that at best it's a &lt;i&gt;mixed bag&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    It's cool and good that people suffer and die from preventable problems, because that means
    that the number representing my almost unimaginable wealth goes up
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    literally every billionaire
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    The obvious answer then to the question of Business Value is that anything that would make
    money for a business is valuable. However, even for things that directly deal with income or
    outgoings it is not always easy to directly identify which changes will lead to the business
    retaining a greater share of capital than it currently does - and this uncertainty is only amplified
    as the relationship becomes more indirect. This uncertainty is not limited only to a risk of
    developments not providing any return, but also the risk of any change actively harming the
    current state of affairs leading to losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Even if it were possible for a business to predict what actions would lead to the best returns
    (that is, those that return the greatest amount of profit) it is not certain that this aligns with
    the best outcome for anyone connected to the business who wants something other than
    maximum profit. Consider these possible actions:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a company fires many workers from it's product team leading to savings on labour but the
    fired workers have now lost their employment, and the remaining team is left with more work
    to split among fewer members causing an increase in stess&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;adding extra data collection to an app allows a company to sell that user data to advertisers
    (or shadier organisations) which brings extra income for the company but worsens the user
    experience and doesn't fit with the ethics of the developers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;rushing a new feature to &lt;i&gt;meet market demands&lt;/i&gt; means that there is no time to properly
    evaluate the impact on the userbase and it's implementation leads to abuse&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Each of these scenarios could include the business realising perceived business value, but the
    other negative effects make them the opposite of valuable to anyone with other values.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Business Value then is at best a vague uncertainty, and at worst actively harmful on a scale only
    limited to those things that the business can affect. Using this as a guide for what work should
    be done is not a responsible way to use people's labour.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-orga25f7ba" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="orga25f7ba"&gt;A business without value?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga25f7ba"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Fine. Ok. A business has to make a profit or it can't exist. Maybe that's not a sensible way of
    organising our whole society given the nightmarish things we've seen it lead to. But fine,
    given the current arrangement of things we'll accept this for now&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    But perhaps we can be a little bit more discerning than just blindly accepting the wild and
    unchecked pursuit of profit at all costs?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    I did it all for the nookie
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Fred Durst, proposing an alternative system of value
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    To simply remove the worst negative aspects of the pursuit of business value, doesn't solve the
    other challenges of determining what would offer positive returns - we need to find an approach
    that allows us to gain some insight into what does. For that matter, we also need to figure out
    a way to navigate with work that might not be quite so cartoonishly villianous, but could still
    have an impact that we aren't comfortable with.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org5b6ef12" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org5b6ef12"&gt;How do we decide what's valuable?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5b6ef12"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    We don't need to throw out all of agile at least, so we can start with working in small increments
    that we immediately make available to get fast feedback. But we are left needing a method of
    judging that feedback, and we also want to be able to judge our own work without needing to
    inflict it on our unsuspecting users. While the users may ultimately decide if we keep or revert a
    change, it is important that we can decide for ourselves which changes we want to focus on in
    the first place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    To this end, I think it is worth making a semi structured attempt to evaluate our own feelings
    about a potential change before, during, and after we make it. Because I am ageing and wish
    to cling to a semblance of my youth, I will call this a &lt;i&gt;Vibe Check&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org2df7780" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org2df7780"&gt;Checking the Vibes&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2df7780"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Search your feelings, you know this code is bad
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Darth Vader (@l33td4rth on github)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    I think it is important to start with a disclaimer that this is not merely intended to be a system of
    self gratification. We are bound by externalities, and the actions we take do affect others - so
    it is necessary to approach a process such as this with a clear understanding of what we aim to
    do and where the limits of our understanding may lie. If I am working on something that will
    impact people who have a significantly different life experience to my own it may fall outside of
    my own competence to evaluate the effects of my changes on those people - but as I do not
    wish to cause harm with my actions it would fall on me to learn about those impacts, this is best
    accomplished by having a person from that group as part of the team I work with so that they are
    constantly involved but if that is not available I can reach outside the team and use  the good ol'
    fallback of talking with people.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Assuming that we are working as part of a team that has reached some level of consensus on
    what types of aims we have, and that we have methods in place to gain additional context from
    outside groups should we need it - we can proceed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-orgca19f18" class="outline-3"&gt;
    &lt;h3 id="orgca19f18"&gt;Thinkin' about the future&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgca19f18"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Before we make a change or build a thing, let's take a moment to consider what it is we're aiming
    to do and if the thing we're doing furthers that goal. Consider that there are many options of things
    to do at any given time, so if there is controversy about an option it could well be safe to just punt
    on it for now, and review it again later if some people still think it's a good idea - sometimes timing
    is a factor, but it's not worth compromising our integrity for a chance at good timing. Overall our
    goal should be to be generally happy and comfortable with what we're making, and happy and
    comfortable with the impact it has - but bear in mind that if something is difficult to do because
    we're doing it the right way to ensure it has a more positive impact, then that is good and the type
    of comfort we ought to be sacrificing rather than taking the easy way out but having worse outcomes
    for people affected by the system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    I promised (semi-)structure so here are some sample questions to ask at this stage, but it's not a
    prescriptive list so feel free to use your own questions that I am sure are definitely better than the
    ones I came up with and you should totally feel good about them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Will this change let our users do more with the system?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Are we clarifying concepts in our domain with this change?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If we had this feature already, what kind of problems would it be causing for us?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Is there a simpler way to get the same benefit?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Does making this change prevent us from doing other things in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Note that these questions are a mix of things that relate to the product and user experience, and
    things that relate to implementation details. I think it is important that we explicitly consider both
    at each stage of this process but understand that it will be necessary to make trade-offs.
    Naturally we want to be thrilled about both aspects, but sometimes providing a feature that is
    beneficial to users will require implementation work that is frustrating or boring and conversely
    sometimes engineering a solution properly will limit features that can be made available. The
    important thing is to be aware of both of these aspects and ensure that we are not violating our
    own constraints on either side for the sake of the other. Or in other words, don't do evil things
    because the tech was cool, and don't refuse to do good things because the tech is boring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org0b6d03a" class="outline-3"&gt;
    &lt;h3 id="org0b6d03a"&gt;Conciously doing&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0b6d03a"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    As work progresses on any given feature/change/iteration we will learn more about what it is
    we're making. Hopefully, any new information we discover will simply confirm that we made a
    fantastic choice to work on this particular thing and that will be that, but more likely we will be
    presented with questions and challenges about the implementation of what we're doing, and
    possibly we might even discover that give us pause about the impact of it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    We need to make space as we work to address this information when we discover it, because if
    it does have a significant impact on how we want to proceed with the work it will save us time,
    frustration, and effort to consider that impact as it is made rather than progressing along a bad
    course and making the costs of change higher. I am certain that by this point, you're brimming
    with ideas for questions to ask when you discover information as you build but I will include
    some samples here for completeness:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Could we deliver a smaller version of this change to avoid technical challenges while still
    getting some benefit?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Should we expand the scope of this change so that it can properly deliver the value we wanted?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Can we reasonably delay this change to implement it in a better way, or should we focus on
    delivering the change now and change the way we implement it later?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[dramatically] Have we underestimated the impact of this change and should abandon it for
    now until we know it won't cause problems?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[less dramatically] Did we discover that this change won't be able to solve the problem that we
    wanted it to? Is it still worth implementing?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    These questions imply the possibility of significantly increasing the amount of work that we need
    to do, or significantly decreasing the amount of stuff we deliver&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and this is often something
    that needs to be coordinated with other people. This potential for disruption when an expected
    timeline has been set is something that makes a lot of people uncomfortable but if we are to
    give a proper amount of respect and consideration to new information then it is to a degree
    unavoidable. It is important then to avoid conflict with people who might rely on our work, that
    we are clear up front about things that can happen during the process. Try where possible, to
    work with people on shared &lt;i&gt;goals&lt;/i&gt; rather than a specific &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;feature&lt;/i&gt; - it is easier to
    let go of a feature when it becomes clear that it is not meeting your needs than when you expect
    it is the solution to your problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org0629258" class="outline-3"&gt;
    &lt;h3 id="org0629258"&gt;Spectating retroactively&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0629258"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Some things are never done. Whenever we deliver something we want to know how well it is
    actually received, how fit it turned out to be for its purpose, how it should impact our future
    changes, and if we learned anything from the process that should change the way we work or
    the questions we ask in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Look upon my works, ye mighty, and tell me on a scale of 1 and 10 how likely you would be to
    recommend them to a friend
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Releasing something new is exciting, it can be all too easy to become attached to what you have
    made and lose focus on what it was supposed to do, be on your guard against such feelings -
    remember the reasons that you do things, not only what you have done.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    When something is out in the world and in use, it can be tempting to search for simple metrics
    that fit nicely onto a graph to evaluate how something was received - the graph is going up, so
    everything is good! Some metrics are good and useful, for example we know
    &lt;a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/"&gt;how fast something should respond&lt;/a&gt; when people are working with it so we can track the
    response times of our own systems to see if they fall into line. Other metrics are less useful,
    if we really want to get a feel for how a change is working out in the world, we need to seek out
    qualitive information from people who actually use it - the ideal scenario being the opportunity
    to watch people use the system and then talking with them afterwards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    The questions that you ask to users should be different to those that you ask yourselves, the goal
    when talking to them is to discover how they use a system and why they did it in that particular way -
    this can often give insights into how it could better work with them to gain a desired result, but it
    can also provide things to consider about how you got here.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Did the results match our expectations?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Was our understanding of the problem domain complete?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How much information did we reveal while making something, and does that information change
    our expectations for the future?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Is there anything we learned during this that we didn't immediately act upon, but now we should
    do something with it?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org4b1bc0e" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org4b1bc0e"&gt;What was all this about?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4b1bc0e"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end I didn't hit my KPIs
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
    You have significant productive capacity, but you can only use it on a limited number of things.
    Those things should not be decided merely by profit, they should be your way of making the world
    better according to your own values and ethics. Ok fine, you don't really have to make things
    better, sometimes getting by is enough - but making things worse as you go isn't fine and you
    are responsible for stopping that from happening. In order to keep track of what you're doing and
    the impact that it's having you should be prepared to question things along the way, before, during,
    and after doing something. You also need to be prepared to deal with the ramifications of acting
    on the information you gained from those questions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    You get to decide these things, and you can produce great stuff - listen to the vibes, don't chase
    blindly after business value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    I do realise that software development is undertaken in contexts other than that of for a business,
    but I can't write about everything. If you are in one of those other contexts, maybe this post is less
    relevant to you, or maybe it is a trove of brilliant insights - I guess the only way to find out is to read it.
    xoxoxo
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.2" class="footnum" href="#fnr.2" role="doc-backlink"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"&gt;&lt;p class="footpara"&gt;
    Should we accept this forever though? Send your answer on the side of a bottle filled
    with burning gasoline to your nearest billionaire's compound.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.3" class="footnum" href="#fnr.3" role="doc-backlink"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"&gt;&lt;p class="footpara"&gt;
    Do not feel the need to inform me that this phrasing is outdated, I simply do not wish to know.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.4" class="footnum" href="#fnr.4" role="doc-backlink"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara" role="doc-footnote"&gt;&lt;p class="footpara"&gt;
    They also imply the opposite of those, but less work and more stuff done are nice things
    so let's just enjoy when that happens eh? 🍹
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Using Indego Robot Mowers from Homey</title>
  <link>https://chamook.lol/indego-homey/</link>
  <description>
    &lt;div id="content" class="container"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    My brother-in-law has a &lt;a href="https://www.bosch-diy.com/dk/da/haveredskaber/robotplaeneklippere"&gt;Bosch Indego&lt;/a&gt; robot mower that he wants to control via &lt;a href="https://homey.app/"&gt;Homey&lt;/a&gt;. There was no
    app readily available, but there is an API available that has several open source clients. I helped him create
    some blocks of &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/app/com.athom.homeyscript/HomeyScript/"&gt;HomeyScript&lt;/a&gt; to call the API and integrate the mower into the rest of his smart home. The code
    here leans heavily on the work already done in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/zazaz-de/iot-device-bosch-indego-controller"&gt;Java Controller Application&lt;/a&gt; and in the
    &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyIndego/"&gt;pyIndego Python Library&lt;/a&gt;, especially the &lt;a href="https://github.com/zazaz-de/iot-device-bosch-indego-controller/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md"&gt;documentation of the protocol&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org2eea2a4" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org2eea2a4"&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2eea2a4"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Most requests in the API require a &lt;code&gt;contextId&lt;/code&gt; value, and to get one of those we first need to make a
    &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request to the &lt;code&gt;/authenticate&lt;/code&gt; endpoint providing some details about the client as well as
    a &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; authentication token.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    The authentication token is built by base64 encoding a string comprised of your username and password
    separated by a colon. This can be done conveniently in most programming languages, such as javascript:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-js" id="org299053b"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; btoa&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"username@email.com:secret-password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    As is, this will output the following (but don't forget to use your actual username and password if you want
    to connect to the API for real):
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;pre class="example"&gt;
    dXNlcm5hbWVAZW1haWwuY29tOnNlY3JldC1wYXNzd29yZA==
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    (Note that the above code sample won't actually work in HomeyScript, so you'll need to use a different approach
    if you want to generate the token as part of that)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    With the token generated we can get a &lt;code&gt;contextId&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;/authenticate&lt;/code&gt; endpoint:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-http" id="org2ee571d"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;https://api.indego.iot.bosch-si.com/api/v1/authenticate&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;Authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;Basic dXNlcm5hbWVAZW1haWwuY29tOnNlY3JldC1wYXNzd29yZA==&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"accept_tc_id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"202012"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"device"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"os_type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"Android"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"os_version"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"4.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"dvc_manuf"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"unknown"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"dvc_type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"unknown"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    The token generated previously is provided in the &lt;code&gt;Authorization&lt;/code&gt; header, while we can use sample data to
    populate most of the fields in the request. It is worth noting that the &lt;code&gt;accept_tc_id&lt;/code&gt; field value will likely
    need to be updated in the future if a new revision of the terms and conditions for the API are released.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-http"&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 
    &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"contextId"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"'3f2a9e8c-93cb-402e-a200-e325859f3ffe"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"userId"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"0a86dc31-7136-4009-9ef6-61ac4cab696e"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"alm_sn"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"000000000"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    This provides us with the &lt;code&gt;contextId&lt;/code&gt; that is needed to make other requests.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Before making other requests we can make this in a HomeyScript function:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-js"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;pull values from the flow editor&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; = args&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt; = args&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;btoa isn't available :(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt; = Buffer.from&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;user + &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;':'&lt;/span&gt; + pwd&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;headerData&lt;/span&gt; = buffer.toString&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'base64'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;authHeader&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'Basic '&lt;/span&gt; + headerData;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;authRequestBody&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        accept_tc_id: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"202012"&lt;/span&gt;,
        device: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;,
        os_type: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"Android"&lt;/span&gt;,
        os_version: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"4.0"&lt;/span&gt;,
        dvc_manuf: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"unknown"&lt;/span&gt;,
        dvc_type: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"unknown"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; fetch&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'https://api.indego.iot.bosch-si.com/api/v1/authenticate'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        method: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'POST'&lt;/span&gt;,
        body: JSON.stringify&lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;authRequestBody&lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;,
        headers: &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'Authorization'&lt;/span&gt;: authHeader,
            &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'Content-Type'&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'application/json'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;fail for any error and return any error message we were given&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;!result.ok&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #afd8af;"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;result.statusText&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; result.json&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;return just the context id because we don't care about the other values&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; body.contextId;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    The two &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; values for &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pwd&lt;/code&gt;  should be provided from the flow editor, and this will output
    the &lt;code&gt;contextId&lt;/code&gt; as a text value, that can then be passed to another function to do something.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org16cb325" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org16cb325"&gt;Get Available Devices&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org16cb325"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    If you already know the serial number for your mower, you can skip this step and just use that to work with it
    directly. If you don't know the serial number or you have multiple mowers that you want to work with, there
    is an API endpoint that will list all the available devices:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-http"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;https://api.indego.iot.bosch-si.com/api/v1/alms/&lt;/span&gt;
    x-im-context-id&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 3f2a9e8c-93cb-402e-a200-e325859f3ffe
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Which will give a list containing the serial number and status code for the mowers connected to the account:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-http"&gt;HTTP/1.1 200
    &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"alm_sn"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"000000000"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"alm_status"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 258
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    The serial number is then used to get more detailed information or to control the mower.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-orgc165d77" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="orgc165d77"&gt;Get Information About The Mower&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc165d77"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Now we have the &lt;code&gt;contextId&lt;/code&gt; and the serial number of the mower we want to work with, we can make
    two different calls to get information about the mower.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-orgd3cb5af" class="outline-3"&gt;
    &lt;h3 id="orgd3cb5af"&gt;State&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3cb5af"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    First &lt;code&gt;/state&lt;/code&gt; will give information about the current state of the mower, we need to include the serial
    number of the mower we want to get information about in the url and the context id is provided as a header:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-http" id="orgcf4a5f7"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;https://api.indego.iot.bosch-si.com/api/v1/alms/{serial-number}/state&lt;/span&gt;
    x-im-context-id&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 3f2a9e8c-93cb-402e-a200-e325859f3ffe
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Which gives a response like this:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-http"&gt;HTTP/1.1 200
    &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"state"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 258&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"enabled"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; true&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"map_update_available"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; true&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"mowed"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 98&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        method: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'GET'&lt;/span&gt;,
        headers: &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'x-im-context-id'&lt;/span&gt;: contextId &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;!result.ok&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #afd8af;"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;result.statusText&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; result.json&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;return battery percentage&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; body.battery.percent;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org7c94378" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org7c94378"&gt;Control the Mower&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c94378"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    With code in place to authenticate with the API and retrieve information about the mower it is quite
    straightforward to control the mower. We just need to make a &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; request to the &lt;code&gt;/state&lt;/code&gt; endpoint
    with the desired state command:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-http"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;PUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;https://api.indego.iot.bosch-si.com/api/v1/alms/{serial number}/state&lt;/span&gt;
    x-im-context-id&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 3f2a9e8c-93cb-402e-a200-e325859f3ffe
    content-type&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; application/json
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"state"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"mow"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    We can issue a &lt;code&gt;mow&lt;/code&gt;  command to start the mower, and a &lt;code&gt;returnToDock&lt;/code&gt; command to stop it and have it
    go back to the dock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    In HomeyScript this can be done like so:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-js"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;pull values from the flow editor&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;contextId&lt;/span&gt; = args&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;serialNumber&lt;/span&gt; = args&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;send the request to the api&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        state: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"mow"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; fetch&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'https://api.indego.iot.bosch-si.com/api/v1/alms/'&lt;/span&gt; + serialNumber + &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'/state'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        method: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'PUT'&lt;/span&gt;,
        body: JSON.stringify&lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;,
        headers: &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'x-im-context-id'&lt;/span&gt;: contextId,
            &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'Content-Type'&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'application/json'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;!result.ok&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #afd8af;"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;result.statusText&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;// &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;this doesn't return a body, so as long as it didn't fail it should be good&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-orgbd27984" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="orgbd27984"&gt;Putting it together&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbd27984"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    The code snippets in this post can be added to HomeyScript cards in the flow editor, and you can link up your
    robot mower to anything else controlled by Homey.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    The screenshot below shows examples of controlling the mower with a virtual device, and monitoring the
    battery percentage with a virtual sensor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Happy Automating!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Literate Programming with Org Mode 🦄 </title>
  <link>https://chamook.lol/literate-programming-with-org/</link>
  <description>
    &lt;div id="content" class="container"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Recently I've been writing &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep"&gt;bicep&lt;/a&gt; for provisioning Azure services, the intent was to create a reusable template that could provision
    different services for different projects. Having never worked with bicep before I wanted to ensure I wrote good documentation that I
    could refer back to later, and decided to try out &lt;a href="https://orgmode.org/"&gt;Org Mode&lt;/a&gt; for its literate programming features to ensure that I kept the documentation
    in sync with the code.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org2e9ad86" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org2e9ad86"&gt;Structured Code&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2e9ad86"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Basic org syntax is a lot like markdown but using different special characters (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; for italics instead of &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; etc) but a more significant
    difference is the approach of using structural blocks for source code. Markdown uses &lt;code&gt;```&lt;/code&gt; to denote a block of code, and some
    processors (like github's) can take a language argument (e.g. &lt;code&gt;``` csharp&lt;/code&gt;) to provide syntax highlighting. Org uses comparitively
    clunky looking &lt;code&gt;#+begin_src&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#+end_src&lt;/code&gt; markers to surround code blocks, but it provides a much richer feature set for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Code blocks take a language parameter just like the one some markdown processors provide, but within emacs this provides access to
    features from the language mode that you would use when editing a file of that type like syntax highlighting and autocompletion. 😀
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-orgcd16a31" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="orgcd16a31"&gt;Execution&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcd16a31"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    For some languages, it is also possible to execute the code directly inside the org file and have any output placed in a results block
    similar to &lt;a href="https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/"&gt;Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    A javascript block with this header line:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-org"&gt;#+begin_src js :results output replace :wrap src json
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    And this javascript code:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-js" id="orgd48066c"&gt;fetch&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      .then&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x =&gt; x.json&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      .then&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x =&gt; console.log&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Executing that code block will output a results section that wraps the result in a json source block:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-json"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      userId: &lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;,
      id: &lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;,
      title: 'quis ut nam facilis et officia qui',
      completed: &lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    But code in org files isn't limited to staying within the file, with &lt;code&gt;org-babel-tangle&lt;/code&gt; you can create code files from your documentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org80a784f" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org80a784f"&gt;Tangling&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org80a784f"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    By adding &lt;code&gt;:tangle&lt;/code&gt; and a filename to the start of a block, you can output code from an org documentation file into a file that only
    contains code, and can even be part of a whole coding project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Using &lt;code&gt;M-x org-babel-tangle&lt;/code&gt; from within emacs on a file containing a block like this:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-org"&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+begin_src csharp :tangle SampleClass.cs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Chamook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;sealed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #afd8af; background-color: #383838;"&gt;SampleClass&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #afd8af; background-color: #383838;"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #afd8af; background-color: #383838;"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; =&gt; Console.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493; background-color: #383838;"&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;"Hello, {Name}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Will output a file called &lt;code&gt;SampleClass.cs&lt;/code&gt; with the code as contents:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-csharp"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;Chamook&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;Sample&lt;/span&gt;;
    
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;sealed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #afd8af;"&gt;SampleClass&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #afd8af;"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff69b4;"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
        &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #afd8af;"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; =&gt; Console.&lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"Hello, {Name}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    This can be broken up across several source blocks and tangled to a single file:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-org"&gt;First declare a namespace:
    
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+begin_src csharp :tangle SampleClass.cs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Chamook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;
    
    Then declare the class:
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+begin_src csharp :tangle SampleClass.cs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;sealed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #afd8af; background-color: #383838;"&gt;SampleClass&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #afd8af; background-color: #383838;"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #afd8af; background-color: #383838;"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; =&gt; Console.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493; background-color: #383838;"&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;"Hello, {Name}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Will tangle to a single &lt;code&gt;SampleClass.cs&lt;/code&gt; file containing code from all the source blocks that tangle to it in the order that they appear in the
    org file.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    One org file can also tangle to multiple code files by specifying different filenames in code blocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-org"&gt;Namespace for my C# file:
    
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+begin_src csharp :tangle SampleClass.cs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Chamook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;
    
    Oh that reminds me of a funny javascript story:
    
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+begin_src js :tangle hahaha.js&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493; background-color: #383838;"&gt;pleaseLaugh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;"hahaha"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;
    
    Then declare a class in the C# file:
    
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+begin_src csharp :tangle SampleClass.cs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;sealed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #afd8af; background-color: #383838;"&gt;SampleClass&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #afd8af; background-color: #383838;"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff69b4; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #afd8af; background-color: #383838;"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493; background-color: #383838;"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; =&gt; Console.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493; background-color: #383838;"&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;"Hello, {Name}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Will output both the &lt;code&gt;.cs&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; files specified.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org2b58f0e" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org2b58f0e"&gt;Conditional Tangling&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2b58f0e"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    For the templates I was creating from an org file, I wanted to be able to pick and choose which parts were included rather than just
    outputting everything. Conveniently emacs can evaluate an emacs-lisp expression as part of the &lt;code&gt;:tangle&lt;/code&gt; definition on a code block,
    meaning that I could check a condition and either return a filename or &lt;code&gt;"no"&lt;/code&gt; which disables tangling for that block. The check
    could look at variables set within the org file, but as I was working on a template that other people might want to use I made it check
    if some dotfiles existed in the same directory:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-org"&gt;#+begin_src bicep :tangle (if (file-exists-p ".Config1") "infra/main.bicep" "no")
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    This block will only be tangled with the &lt;code&gt;main.bicep&lt;/code&gt; file if there is a file called &lt;code&gt;.Config1&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory as the org file.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-orgfce8a14" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="orgfce8a14"&gt;Backfilling Values with Noweb&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfce8a14"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Building templates that were configurable in this way led to a scenario where sometimes I would need to include values in an earlier part of a
    bicep file only if a later block was tangled. Source blocks in org mode support using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb"&gt;noweb&lt;/a&gt; style markup to include either the contents
    or the result of evaluating other blocks in the document, which provides a nice way of solving this problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    In the initial block that may need a value from later, I can enable noweb replacements by specifying &lt;code&gt;:noweb yes&lt;/code&gt; and then add a
    reference to the later contents:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-org"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+begin_src :noweb yes&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;&lt;maybe-from-later()&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    Then later include a named block, that performs the check for the dotfile and returns a value if it is present, or an empty string otherwise:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-org"&gt;#name: maybe-from-later
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+begin_src emacs-lisp :cache no&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff; background-color: #383838;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;file-exists-p &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;".config2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400; background-color: #383838;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;"// the file exists"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000; background-color: #383838;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-orgac6dd24" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="orgac6dd24"&gt;Tangling for the non-Emacs user&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgac6dd24"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    A template is less useful if it constrains people to use a specific editor (with a relatively steep learning curve) to be able to get any value from
    it, but fortunately Emacs can be called from the command line to tangle a file so I included a shell script with my template. (I actually tangled
    the shell script from the template itself 🤘):
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-org"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+begin_src bash :tangle tangle.sh :shebang "#!/bin/bash"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;emacs --batch &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;      --eval &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;"(require 'org)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;      --eval &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;"(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="background-color: #383838;"&gt;      --eval &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C; background-color: #383838;"&gt;'(org-babel-tangle-file "file.org")'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #008ED1; background-color: #2b2b2b;"&gt;#+end_src&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    This passes several snippets of emacs-lisp for emacs to evaluate:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; '&lt;span style="color: #96CBFE;"&gt;org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    First ensures that org-mode is loaded, then we edit the org-babel configuration slightly:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    This disables the prompt before evaluating each code block so that a user doesn't have to type &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt; for each block that is evaluated.
    With that config change in place it's just a matter to call the function that will actually tangle our org file and tell it which file to operate on:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;org-babel-tangle-file &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"file.org"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    With this the org file is tangled and nobody had to open an emacs window or learn any keybindings 😅 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div id="outline-container-org7a1bd1a" class="outline-2"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="org7a1bd1a"&gt;Exporting&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a1bd1a"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    After working with org files a bunch to create this template, I discovered that there is also a fairly customizable export functionality -
    by setting a few config values:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; org-html-doctype &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"html5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; org-html-postamble-format '&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"&lt;footer class=\"page-footer\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;  &lt;a href=\"../index.html\"&gt;&amp;lt;- M-x find-more-content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; org-html-postamble 't&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #4c83ff;"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; org-html-preamble-format '&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;"&lt;header&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;  &lt;h1 class=\"glitch-text\" data-text=\"%t\"&gt;%t&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;  &lt;span class=\"subtitle\"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;&lt;div class=\"byline\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;  &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;    &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/chamooktweets\"&gt;Adam Guest&lt;/a&gt; - %d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #61CE3C;"&gt;&lt;/header&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #ff1493;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #006400;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8b0000;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    And adding some extra values to include in the html at the top of the document:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;
    &lt;pre class="src src-org"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;#+options: toc:nil num:nil html-style:nil html5-fancy:'t title:nil exports:both&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;#+html_content_class: container&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;#+html_head: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../style.css"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;#+html_head: &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;#+html_head:&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;#+html_head:&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="../apple-touch-icon.png"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;#+html_head:&lt;link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="../favicon-32x32.png"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;#+html_head:&lt;meta property="og:type" content="article" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style="color: #8B8989; font-style: italic;"&gt;#+html_head:&lt;meta property="article:published_time" content="2022-08-12T00:00:00+00:00" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
    I can use &lt;code&gt;org-export-dispatch&lt;/code&gt; to generate this html page 😍 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
